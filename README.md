# 👋 Hi, I'm Joudi!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m excited to share my journey in data science and analytics. With a bachelor's degree in Kinesiology and Health Sciences, I witnessed the transformative power of data in healthcare, where much of what I learned in my degree was grounded in research-driven insights. This inspired me to transition into data analytics to leverage data to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions in various industries. Currently, I’m completing a certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics at Toronto Metropolitan University. While I’m still scratching the surface, I’m passionate about using data to solve problems, building meaningful projects, and learning and applying new concepts to my work.

## 🔍 Why I do what I do:

Data is more than just numbers; it’s a powerful lens to understand the world and drive impact. I’m passionate about crafting solutions that make a difference, with a keen interest in social impact analysis. While I’m still carving out my niche, I’m inspired by the potential to use data as a tool for equity and progress.

## 💡 How I approach the craft:

For me, every piece of a data project is a puzzle piece in the bigger picture. Whether it’s cleaning raw data or designing insightful dashboards, I value excellence in every step because small details often hold the key to big breakthroughs. My approach is organic and rational, blending intuition with deep analysis.
