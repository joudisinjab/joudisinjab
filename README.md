# 👋 Hi, I'm Joudi!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m excited to share my journey in data science and analytics. With a bachelor's degree in Kinesiology and Health Sciences, I witnessed the transformative power of data in healthcare, where much of what I learned in my degree was grounded in research-driven insights. This inspired me to transition into data analytics to leverage data to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions in various industries. Currently, I’m completing a certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics at Toronto Metropolitan University. While I’m still scratching the surface, I’m passionate about using data to solve problems, building meaningful projects, and learning and applying new concepts to my work.
